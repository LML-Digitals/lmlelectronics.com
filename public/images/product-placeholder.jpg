# Product Placeholder Image

This file should be a 800x600 placeholder image for products without images.
You can replace this with an actual image file or use a service like:
- https://placehold.co/800x600/cccccc/666666?text=No+Image
- Or create a simple gray placeholder image

The image should be named "product-placeholder.jpg" and placed in the public/images/ directory.
